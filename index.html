            <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        The Brown University Health Data Fest will bring together undergraduate students
        to tackle real-world environmental health challenges using Rhode Island water quality data.
        Participants will collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to generate data-driven insights
        and present their findings to faculty judges.
    </p>
    <p>
        This event is sponsored by the Department of Biostatistics and the Data Science Institute at Brown University.
        We would also like to thank Sara Horvet and Molly Welsh from the <a href="https://www.stormwaterinnovation.org/about">Stormwater Innovation Center</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Please contact Alice Paul (alice_paul@brown.edu) or Peter Lipman (peter_lipman@brown.edu) for questions about the event.

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
        As the Ocean State, Rhode Island’s identity, economy, and public health are closely tied to 
        its coastal and inland waters, including Narragansett Bay and its surrounding rivers and ponds. 
        Routine water quality monitoring plays a critical role in detecting changes in nutrients, 
        bacteria, and algae that can threaten ecosystems, recreational use, and human health. 
        These data support timely public health decisions, such as beach advisories and closures, 
        and help guide long-term environmental management.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SPH Health Data Fest will focus cyanobacteria blooms. Cyanobacteria blooms—often referred 
        to as blue-green algae blooms—occur in nutrient-rich waters and are increasingly common 
        during warm periods. These blooms can disrupt aquatic ecosystems by blocking sunlight and 
        depleting oxygen, and some produce toxins that pose risks to both human and animal health. 
        Climate change is contributing to more frequent and intense rainfall and warmer water 
        temperatures, increasing the prevalence and severity of cyanobacteria blooms.
     </p>
    <p>   
        The Stormwater Innovation Center (SIC) is a collaborative initiative dedicated to 
        improving stormwater management and water quality across Rhode Island through research, 
        monitoring, outreach, and community partnerships. At the Health Data Fest, SIC data and 
        expertise will provide students with insight into how environmental and public health data 
        are collected, managed, and analyzed, and how these data can be used to better understand 
        risks, evaluate interventions, and inform policies that protect water quality and public 
        health statewide.

    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>
        Applications are open to all undergraduate students at Brown with some background in statistics, data science, and/or public health. 
        Students may apply as a free agent or in teams of 2-3. Organizers will work to help balance the skill sets across teams. 
        <strong>Applications are due by Thursday, March 19th.</strong> 

        Participants are expected to attend the kick-off event on Thursday, April 2nd, have availability to meet with their team Friday, 
        April 3rd, and be able to attend the presentations and awards on Saturday, April 4th. You will be notified by March 20th if 
        your application is accepted. If you are no longer able to attend, please email Alice Paul (alice_paul@brown.edu) so we can 
        accept another student.
